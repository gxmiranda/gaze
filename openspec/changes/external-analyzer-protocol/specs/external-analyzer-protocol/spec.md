## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: JSON-RPC Protocol Client

The `protocol` package MUST implement a JSON-RPC 2.0 client that spawns an external analyzer binary as a subprocess, communicates via stdin/stdout, and supports the 8 protocol methods defined in Issue #95. The client MUST handle request ID sequencing, response matching, error responses, and subprocess lifecycle (spawn, communicate, shutdown).

#### Scenario: Successful protocol session

- **GIVEN** a mock analyzer binary that responds to all 8 protocol methods
- **WHEN** the protocol client spawns the binary and executes a full session (initialize → discover → analyze → complexity → coverage → test_mapping → classify_signals → shutdown)
- **THEN** all responses MUST be correctly parsed and the subprocess MUST exit cleanly

#### Scenario: Analyzer binary not found

- **GIVEN** a non-existent analyzer binary name
- **WHEN** the protocol client attempts to spawn it
- **THEN** the client MUST return an error indicating the binary was not found in PATH

#### Scenario: Analyzer crashes mid-session

- **GIVEN** an analyzer binary that exits unexpectedly after responding to `initialize`
- **WHEN** the protocol client sends the next request
- **THEN** the client MUST detect the closed stdin/stdout and return an error with context

---

### Requirement: External Provider Adapters

The `adapter` package MUST implement four types that satisfy the Phase 1 provider interfaces (`ComplexityProvider`, `LineCoverageProvider`, `SideEffectAnalyzer`, `ContractCoverageProvider`) by translating JSON-RPC protocol responses into the expected Go types. Each adapter MUST hold a reference to the protocol client and call the appropriate protocol method in its interface method.

#### Scenario: Complexity adapter translates protocol response

- **GIVEN** an `ExternalComplexityProvider` connected to a mock analyzer
- **WHEN** `Analyze` is called
- **THEN** the adapter MUST call the `complexity` protocol method and return `[]crap.FunctionComplexity` with correctly mapped fields

#### Scenario: Coverage adapter translates protocol response

- **GIVEN** an `ExternalLineCoverageProvider` connected to a mock analyzer
- **WHEN** `Coverage` is called
- **THEN** the adapter MUST call the `coverage` protocol method and return `[]crap.FuncCoverage` with correctly mapped fields

#### Scenario: Side effect adapter translates protocol response

- **GIVEN** an `ExternalSideEffectAnalyzer` connected to a mock analyzer
- **WHEN** `Analyze` is called
- **THEN** the adapter MUST call the `analyze` protocol method and return `[]taxonomy.AnalysisResult` with `Classification` attached to each `SideEffect`

#### Scenario: Contract coverage adapter with test_mapping

- **GIVEN** an `ExternalContractCoverageProvider` connected to an analyzer that supports `test_mapping`
- **WHEN** `Build` is called
- **THEN** the adapter MUST call `test_mapping`, compute contract coverage using `quality.ComputeContractCoverage`, and return a lookup function

#### Scenario: Contract coverage adapter without test_mapping

- **GIVEN** an `ExternalContractCoverageProvider` connected to an analyzer that does NOT support `test_mapping` (capability is false)
- **WHEN** `Build` is called
- **THEN** the adapter MUST return a lookup function that always returns `(zero, false)` and an empty degraded packages list — GazeCRAP is unavailable

---

### Requirement: Capability Negotiation

The `initialize` method response MUST include a `capabilities` object declaring which optional methods the analyzer supports. The protocol client MUST store these capabilities and the adapter layer MUST check them before calling optional methods.

#### Scenario: Analyzer declares test_mapping capability

- **GIVEN** an analyzer that responds to `initialize` with `capabilities.test_mapping: true`
- **WHEN** gaze runs the analysis pipeline
- **THEN** the `test_mapping` method MUST be called and GazeCRAP scores MUST be computed

#### Scenario: Analyzer declares no optional capabilities

- **GIVEN** an analyzer that responds to `initialize` with `capabilities.test_mapping: false` and `capabilities.classify_signals: false`
- **WHEN** gaze runs the analysis pipeline
- **THEN** gaze MUST skip `test_mapping` and `classify_signals`, produce CRAP scores (from complexity + coverage), and omit GazeCRAP/quadrant data

---

### Requirement: Analyzer Discovery

Gaze MUST discover analyzer binaries through a three-tier mechanism: (1) `--analyzer <name>` CLI flag, (2) `.gaze.yaml` `analyzers.<language>.command` config, (3) `gaze-analyzer-<language>` PATH convention. The first match wins.

#### Scenario: CLI flag overrides config

- **GIVEN** a `.gaze.yaml` with `analyzers.python.command: snake-eyes` and the user runs `gaze crap --analyzer my-analyzer ./...`
- **WHEN** gaze discovers the analyzer
- **THEN** `my-analyzer` MUST be used, not `snake-eyes`

#### Scenario: PATH convention fallback

- **GIVEN** no `--analyzer` flag, no `.gaze.yaml` `analyzers` section, and `gaze-analyzer-python` exists in PATH
- **WHEN** gaze discovers the analyzer for Python
- **THEN** `gaze-analyzer-python` MUST be used

#### Scenario: No analyzer found

- **GIVEN** no `--analyzer` flag, no config, and no `gaze-analyzer-*` in PATH
- **WHEN** gaze runs without `--analyzer` on a Go project
- **THEN** gaze MUST use the default Go providers (existing behavior, no error)

---

### Requirement: CLI Flags

The `analyze`, `crap`, `quality`, and `report` commands MUST accept `--analyzer <name>` and `--language <lang>` flags. When `--analyzer` is specified, external provider adapters MUST be constructed instead of Go providers. When neither flag is specified, behavior MUST be identical to today.

#### Scenario: Analyze with external analyzer

- **GIVEN** `--analyzer snake-eyes` specified on `gaze crap`
- **WHEN** gaze runs
- **THEN** gaze MUST spawn `snake-eyes --stdio`, run the protocol session, and produce CRAP scores from the external data

#### Scenario: No analyzer flag preserves Go behavior

- **GIVEN** no `--analyzer` or `--language` flag specified
- **WHEN** gaze runs `gaze crap ./...`
- **THEN** behavior MUST be identical to the current Go-only implementation

---

### Requirement: Analyzers Configuration

The `.gaze.yaml` file MUST support an `analyzers` section for mapping languages to analyzer binaries:

```yaml
analyzers:
  python:
    command: snake-eyes
    args: ["--stdio"]
```

#### Scenario: Config-based analyzer discovery

- **GIVEN** `.gaze.yaml` with `analyzers.python.command: snake-eyes` and `analyzers.python.args: ["--stdio"]`
- **WHEN** gaze discovers the Python analyzer
- **THEN** it MUST spawn `snake-eyes --stdio`

## MODIFIED Requirements

None — the scoring core (`crap.Analyze`, `Formula`, `ClassifyQuadrant`, `computeScores`) is unchanged. External adapters provide data through the same provider interfaces that Go adapters use.

## REMOVED Requirements

None
